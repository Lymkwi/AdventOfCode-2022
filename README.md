# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2022 puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) written in Rust.

Can be found both on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lymkwi/AdventOfCode-2022) and [my Gitea](https://git.vulpinecitrus.info/Lymkwi/AdventOfCode-2022).

This code in organized with :
 - A top-level crate to run tests and benchmarks
 - Sub-level crates for each day (`dayXX`)
 - A common crate for the common methods

In order to check those benchmarks, run `cargo bench` on the root crate.

## Sub-level day crates

The sublevel day crates are both executable and libraries. The main logic is
always implemented in `lib.rs` but a main method exists in `main.rs` to read
the data file and show the answers. So, you can go to any day and run
`cargo run` to see the day's answers.
```
dayXX
|- Cargo.toml
`- src/
   |- main.rs
   `- lib.rs
```

### Tests

Every sub-level day crate contains tests for the examples given on that day. You can run `cargo test` in those day crates to see that examples are successfully processed.

## The common crate

The `common` crate defines methods and macros used by multiple day crates :
 - `read_data` : reads the data from the file into a `String`
 - `tests!` : a macro designed to write quick unit tests based on an input and the expected output

## Top-level tests and benchmarks

The metrics provided above are computed using `cargo bench` in the top-level crate. That crate also contains tests to check that the results of the computation
are still valid for all days and parts.
